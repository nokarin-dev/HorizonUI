![Installation](https://github.com/nokarin-dev/horizonui/blob/main/assets/Installation_Banner.png?raw=true)

1. Download the HorizonUI .jar file from one of the trusted platforms below:
    - [CurseForge]
    - [Modrinth]

2. Place the downloaded file into your Minecraft mods folder:
    - Windows: C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods
    - Linux/macOS: ~/.minecraft/mods

3. Launch Minecraft using a supported mod loader.

HorizonUI will activate automatically when the game starts

> **Using a custom launcher?** MultiMC, Prism Launcher, GDLauncher, and other custom launchers are fully supported. Simply add the mod to the instance’s mods folder or import it via the launcher’s built‑in mod manager.

---

![Usage](https://github.com/nokarin-dev/horizonui/blob/main/assets/Usage_Banner.png?raw=true)

Once installed, HorizonUI integrates directly into the game UI.

You can configure HorizonUI through:
- The in‑game **Mod Configuration** screen
- Resource Packs for background customization

Changes are applied in real time or after a screen reload, depending on the setting. ()

---

![Compatibility](https://github.com/nokarin-dev/horizonui/blob/main/assets/Compatibility_Banner.png?raw=true)

HorizonUI focuses heavily on UI customization, including layout structure and background rendering. As a result, **mods that also modify Minecraft’s user interface or background systems may conflict**.

**Potential sources of incompatibility include**:
- Mods that overhaul or replace the main menu or HUD
- Shader mods that affect 2D UI layers or post‑processing
- Mods that alter how background textures are loaded or rendered

**If you encounter issues**:
- Temporarily disable other UI‑related mods.
- Check whether shader packs affect UI rendering.
- Restart the game after modifying resource packs.
- Report confirmed conflicts on the GitHub issue tracker.

![Recommendations](https://github.com/nokarin-dev/horizonui/blob/main/assets/Recommendations_Banner.png?raw=true)

To achieve the best visual experience with HorizonUI, it is highly recommended to use **font customization mods** that replace Minecraft’s default font.

Suggested mods:
- [BetterFonts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterfonts)
- [Smooth Font](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/smooth-font)
- [Caxton](https://modrinth.com/mod/caxton)

Using modern fonts such as **Poppins**, **Inter**, or **Segoe UI** significantly improves readability and overall UI consistency.

![FAQ](https://github.com/nokarin-dev/horizonui/blob/main/assets/FAQ_Banner.png?raw=true)

<details>
<summary><strong>Open Here</strong></summary>

- **Why isn't the animated background showing up?**
  - Animated backgrounds are distributed separately as resource packs to keep the main mod lightweight and performant. You can download them from [Han's Official Discord Server] or make it manually.

- **I've downloaded the animated background, but it's still not showing on the title screen. Why?**
  - Make sure you've enabled the background resource pack in the _Resource Packs_ menu. Then, go to the mod configuration screen to select your desired background.

- **What's the minimum system requirement to run this mod smoothly?**
  - We recommend allocating at least 4–6 GB of RAM, and using a processor equivalent to Intel Core i5 8th Gen or better with an integrated GPU.

- **Where do I report bugs or issues?**
  - Please report any bugs or issues on the [HorizonUI GitHub Repository].

- **Is HorizonUI compatible with other UI or shader mods?**
  - HorizonUI aims to be compatible with most mods, but UI or shader mods may conflict. If you find issues, try disabling other mods temporarily or report the conflict to us.

- **How do I reset HorizonUI settings to default?**
  - You can delete the HorizonUI configuration file found in the `config/horizonui` folder within your Minecraft directory.

- **Does HorizonUI support older versions of Minecraft?**
  - Yes, but updates are released gradually per version. If your version isn't supported yet, please wait for upcoming releases.
